This is the moment where character theory becomes *real*.

We’re going to build the **entire character table of $S_3$** using only:

- the idea that a character measures “how much stays in place”,
- the fact that characters are constant on conjugacy classes,
- and one magical rule: orthogonality.

No advanced theorems needed.

---

## 1. The group $S_3$

$S_3$ is the group of all permutations of three objects.

It has:

- $6$ elements
- $3$ conjugacy classes:

| cycle type | example | size |
|---|---:|---:|
| identity | $(1)$ | $1$ |
| transpositions | $(12)$ | $3$ |
| 3-cycles | $(123)$ | $2$ |

Characters will only depend on these three types.

---

## 2. How many irreducible representations?

This fact is deep, but we’ll *use* it without proof:

> The number of irreducible representations of a finite group  
> equals the number of conjugacy classes.

Since $S_3$ has **3 conjugacy classes**, it must have **3 irreducible representations**.

So our character table will have:

- 3 rows (irreps)
- 3 columns (conjugacy classes)

Already very structured.

## 3. The trivial representation

Every group has one:

$$
\rho_{\text{triv}}(g) = 1
$$

for all $g$.

So the character is:

$$
\chi_{\text{triv}}(g) = 1.
$$

Row 1:

| class | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{triv}}$ | 1 | 1 | 1 |

---

## 4. The sign representation

Permutations are:

- even → sign $+1$
- odd → sign $-1$

Transpositions are odd.  
3-cycles are even.

So:

| class | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{sgn}}$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |

This gives row 2.

---

## 5. We need one more representation

We know there must be a 3rd irreducible representation.

Where do we get it?

From the geometric representation from Post 1:

> $S_3$ acts on $\mathbb{R}^3$ by permuting coordinates.

Its character values were:

- identity fixes 3 directions → trace $3$
- a transposition fixes 1 direction → trace $1$
- a $120^\circ$ rotation fixes nothing → trace $0$

So the character is:

| class | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{perm}}$ | $3$ | $1$ | $0$ |

---

## 6. But this representation is NOT irreducible

We can see this because it has:

$$
\langle \chi_{\text{perm}}, \chi_{\text{triv}} \rangle \neq 0
$$

which means it contains a trivial piece.

Geometrically:

- the vector $(1,1,1)$ is fixed by all permutations
- so there is a 1-dimensional invariant subspace

This means:

> the permutation representation splits into:
>
> trivial representation + a 2-dimensional irreducible representation

So:

$$
\chi_{\text{perm}} = \chi_{\text{triv}} + \chi_{\text{std}}
$$

Thus:

$$
\chi_{\text{std}} = \chi_{\text{perm}} - \chi_{\text{triv}}
$$

Compute it:

| class | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{std}}$ | $3-1=2$ | $1-1=0$ | $0-1=-1$ |

This is the famous **standard representation** of $S_3$.

---

## 7. The full character table

Now we have all three irreducible characters:

| irreducible | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{triv}}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $\chi_{\text{sgn}}$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |
| $\chi_{\text{std}}$ | $2$ | $0$ | $-1$ |

This is the **character table of $S_3$**.

---

## 8. The magical check: orthogonality

Characters satisfy:

$$
\langle \chi_i, \chi_j \rangle
= \frac{1}{|S_3|}
\sum_{\text{classes}} |C|\, \chi_i(C)\overline{\chi_j(C)}
$$

Plug in the table:

- rows are orthogonal
- norms are 1

This confirms:

- we found all irreps  
- nothing is missing  
- nothing is duplicated

---

## 9. Why this is beautiful

We went from:

- 6 group elements
- acting by $3\times3$ matrices

to:

- 3 numbers per representation

and yet we kept all the essential structure.

Characters compress symmetry incredibly efficiently.

This is why chemists, physicists, and mathematicians love character tables.

---

## 10. Where we go next

Now that we have one full character table, we can:

- build the character table of $C_n$
- generalize to $S_n$
- talk about orthogonality more deeply
- connect to representation theory research (GVZ groups, o-basis groups)
