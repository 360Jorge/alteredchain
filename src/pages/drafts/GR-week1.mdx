In special relativity, the quantity

$$
s^2 = t^2 - x^2
$$

is the analogue of squared distance in Euclidean space. Lorentz transformations
preserve this “Minkowski norm”, so curves of constant $s^2$ are invariant.

<HyperbolaPreservation />

These hyperbolae are the sets where $t^2 - x^2$ is constant. As you change the
rapidity $\eta$ (and therefore the velocity $v = \tanh \eta$), the primed axes
rotate, but the hyperbolae stay fixed: the geometry of spacetime is the real
invariant object.
