So far:

- we know what a representation is,
- we understand characters as “how much survives,”
- and we built the full character table of $S_3$ by hand.

Now comes one of the most powerful ideas in representation theory:

> **Characters are orthogonal, and that lets us decompose any representation into irreducibles.**

This post is almost magical because:

- we will never write a matrix,
- we will never change bases,
- and yet we will break a representation apart perfectly.

## 1. The inner product of characters

Given two characters $\chi$ and $\psi$ of a finite group $G$, define:

$$
\langle \chi, \psi \rangle
= \frac{1}{|G|}
\sum_{g \in G} \chi(g)\,\overline{\psi(g)}.
$$

This looks random, but it behaves like an inner product.

Since characters are constant on conjugacy classes, we can rewrite it as:

$$
\langle \chi, \psi \rangle
= \frac{1}{|G|}
\sum_{\text{classes } C} |C|\, \chi(C)\,\overline{\psi(C)}.
$$

That version is the one we actually compute.

## 2. The magical theorem (no proof for now)

> If $\chi_1,\dots,\chi_k$ are the irreducible characters of $G$, then:

> $$
> \langle \chi_i, \chi_j \rangle = 
> \begin{cases}
> 1 & i=j\\
> 0 & i\ne j
> \end{cases}
> $$

This is the **orthogonality of characters**.

Interpretation:

- irreducible characters behave like an orthonormal basis
- every character “points in a different direction”

This is wild:

Characters live in $\mathbb{C}^k$ (one value per conjugacy class), and irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis of that space.

## 3. Why this matters

Let $\chi$ be the character of *any* representation.

Then we can write:

$$
\chi = m_1\chi_1 + m_2\chi_2 + \dots + m_k \chi_k
$$

where:

- $\chi_i$ are irreducible characters
- $m_i$ are nonnegative integers

And the miracle is:

$$
m_i = \langle \chi, \chi_i \rangle.
$$

That one formula lets us:

✅ detect whether a representation is irreducible  
✅ compute how many copies of each irreducible appear  
✅ decompose representations effortlessly

No matrices required.

## 4. Example: decomposing the permutation representation of $S_3$

From the previous post, the permutation character was:

| class | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{perm}}$ | $3$ | $1$ | $0$ |

And the irreducible characters were:

| irreducible | $e$ | transpositions | 3-cycles |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| $\chi_{\text{triv}}$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $\chi_{\text{sgn}}$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |
| $\chi_{\text{std}}$ | $2$ | $0$ | $-1$ |

We now compute:

$$
m_{\text{triv}} = \langle \chi_{\text{perm}}, \chi_{\text{triv}} \rangle
$$

Use:

- $|S_3| = 6$
- conjugacy class sizes $(1,3,2)$

Compute:

$$
\frac{1}{6}\big(1\cdot 3\cdot 1 + 3\cdot 1\cdot 1 + 2\cdot 0\cdot 1\big)
= \frac{6}{6} = 1
$$

So the trivial representation appears once.

---

Next:

$$
m_{\text{sgn}} = \langle \chi_{\text{perm}}, \chi_{\text{sgn}} \rangle
$$

Compute:

$$
\frac{1}{6}\big(1\cdot 3\cdot 1 + 3\cdot 1\cdot (-1) + 2\cdot 0\cdot 1\big)
= \frac{0}{6} = 0
$$

So the sign representation does *not* appear.

---

Finally:

$$
m_{\text{std}} = \langle \chi_{\text{perm}}, \chi_{\text{std}} \rangle
$$

Compute:

$$
\frac{1}{6}\big(1\cdot 3\cdot 2 + 3\cdot 1\cdot 0 + 2\cdot 0\cdot (-1)\big)
= \frac{6}{6} = 1
$$

So:

> $\chi_{\text{perm}} = \chi_{\text{triv}} + \chi_{\text{std}}$

which matches what we saw geometrically.

## 5. This is HUGE

With a tiny computation, we learned:

- the permutation representation splits
- it contains exactly one copy of the trivial rep
- and exactly one copy of the standard rep
- nothing else

We didn't:

- diagonalize a matrix
- find invariant subspaces manually
- write a change of basis
- compute an eigenvector

All the decomposition information was already encoded in the character.

## 6. Why orthogonality is a superpower

Orthogonality turns the space of characters into:

> a vector space with an orthonormal basis given by irreducibles

That means:

- every representation is a linear combination of irreps
- coefficients are easy to compute
- decomposition is unique
- multiplicities are integers automatically

This is one of the reasons representation theory is so powerful in:

- chemistry (molecular vibration modes)
- physics (quantum states and symmetry)
- number theory (Galois representations)
- combinatorics (group actions)

## 7. Where we're going next

Now that we have the decomposition tool, we can:

-  decompose representations of $C_n$
-  build character tables of other groups
-  connect to Fourier analysis
-  relate to your research notes

Next post:

> How orthogonality *is* Fourier analysis on finite groups.

Yes — the character table of a finite abelian group *is literally* a Fourier basis.

Mind-blowing stuff ahead.
