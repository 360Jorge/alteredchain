When I first heard “representation theory”, it sounded like some mysterious higher algebra subject:

> “We study representations of groups on vector spaces via modules over group algebras…”

Cool. But also: what?

In this post I want to describe **what a representation actually *is*** in the most concrete way I can, using only:

- basic group ideas (like symmetries), and  
- linear algebra (matrices acting on vectors).

Later, we’ll climb to characters and character tables. But here, the only goal is:

> A representation is just a way to let a group act by linear transformations on a vector space.

## 1. Symmetries you already know

Take an equilateral triangle with vertices labeled $1,2,3$.

There are 6 symmetries:

- the identity (do nothing),
- two rotations (by $120^\circ$ and $240^\circ$),
- three reflections.

Under each symmetry, the vertices get permuted. For example:

- a $120^\circ$ rotation sends $1\to2$, $2\to3$, $3\to1$,
- a reflection across a height might swap $2$ and $3$ and fix $1$.

All these symmetries form a group called $D_3$ or $S_3$ (the symmetric group on 3 letters).

What matters: **each group element tells you how to shuffle the vertices.**

---

## 2. Turning symmetries into matrices

Now look at the vector space
$$
V = \mathbb{R}^3
$$
with basis vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3$ corresponding to the vertices $1,2,3$.

Think of a vector
$$
v = a\,e_1 + b\,e_2 + c\,e_3
$$
as assigning weights $(a,b,c)$ to the 3 vertices.

A symmetry of the triangle permutes the vertices. So it should also permute the coordinates of any vector.

For example, the $120^\circ$ rotation that sends $1\to2$, $2\to3$, $3\to1$ should send
$$
e_1 \mapsto e_2,\quad
e_2 \mapsto e_3,\quad
e_3 \mapsto e_1.
$$

As a matrix (acting on column vectors in the basis $e_1,e_2,e_3$), that rotation is
$$
R =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Because:
- the first column is the image of $e_1$ written in the basis (here $e_1\mapsto e_2$),
- the second column is the image of $e_2$,
- the third is the image of $e_3$.

The identity symmetry corresponds to the identity matrix $I_3$.  
Every symmetry of the triangle can be turned into a $3\times3$ matrix this way.

So from the group of symmetries $S_3$ we’ve built a map
$$
\rho : S_3 \longrightarrow \mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{R})
$$
that sends each symmetry to the corresponding permutation matrix.

This map $\rho$ is **a group representation.**

## 3. What a representation really is

Formally:

> A **representation** of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$ is a homomorphism
> $$
> \rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V),
> $$
> where $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ is the group of invertible linear maps $V \to V$.

This is really just a fancy way of saying:

> To each group element $g \in G$ we assign an invertible linear transformation
> $$
> \rho(g): V \to V
> $$
> in such a way that
> $$
> \rho(gh) = \rho(g)\,\rho(h) \quad\text{and}\quad \rho(e) = \mathrm{Id}_V.
> $$

In the triangle example:

- $G = S_3$,
- $V = \mathbb{R}^3$,
- $\rho(g)$ is “permute the coordinates according to the symmetry $g$”.

The key point: **the group now acts linearly on vectors**.

Instead of just thinking “$g$ shuffles vertices”, we can think “$g$ is a matrix.”

## 4. Why do we care about linear actions?

Groups on their own can be pretty abstract. But linear algebra is something we know how to work with:

- we can take eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
- we can compute traces and determinants,
- we can decompose a space into invariant subspaces.

Representation theory says:

> Study a group by looking at all the ways it can act linearly on vector spaces.

The wild thing is that for many finite groups, **a small list of building-block representations** (the irreducible ones) already captures a huge amount of information about the group.

Later posts will introduce:

- **characters** $\chi(g) = \operatorname{trace}(\rho(g))$, which compress a whole matrix down to one number that still remembers a lot of structure,
- **character tables**, which are like “fingerprints” of a group, especially useful in finite groups and chemistry/physics.

## 5. Another simple example: rotations of the plane

Take the group
$$
C_n = \{ \text{rotations of the plane by } 0, \tfrac{2\pi}{n}, \dots, \tfrac{2\pi(n-1)}{n} \}.
$$

This group already *is* a group of linear transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2$:
each rotation is a $2\times2$ matrix
$$
R_k =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(2\pi k/n) & -\sin(2\pi k/n) \\
\sin(2\pi k/n) & \cos(2\pi k/n)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

So here:

- $G = C_n$,
- $V = \mathbb{R}^2$,
- $\rho(k) = R_k$ is a representation.

In fact, $C_n$ has many more representations (for example on $\mathbb{C}$ by multiplication by complex roots of unity), and those will show up naturally when we talk about characters.

But the takeaway is:

> Any time a group acts by symmetries of a geometric object, you usually get a representation “for free” on some vector space of coordinates.

## 6. Where this is going

In the next posts, I want to:

1. **Define characters** $\chi(g) = \operatorname{trace}(\rho(g))$ and explain why the trace is the right “summary” of a matrix.
2. Build **the character table of $S_3$** from scratch.
3. Talk a bit about **orthogonality of characters** and how it lets you decode a lot of structure.

If you want a more traditional, theorem-heavy approach, you can check out the lecture notes from my Abstract Algebra II course with Dr. Harmon — they follow the standard path (representations, characters, orthogonality, examples) but in a very clean, structured way.
