In the first post we said:

> A representation of a group $G$ is a homomorphism $\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$.

That means every group element acts as an invertible linear transformation on a vector space.

But matrices can be annoying to work with.  
What if we could compress each matrix into **one number** that still remembers a lot about the action?

That number is the **character**.

## 1. The idea

Given a representation $\rho$, we define its **character**:

$$
\chi(g) = \operatorname{trace}(\rho(g)).
$$

So instead of attaching a whole matrix to $g$, we attach just one number.

At first this feels random:

> Why the trace? Why not determinant? Or rank? Or the $(1,1)$ entry?

But the trace turns out to measure something very geometric:

> $\chi(g)$ tells you **how much of the vector space survives** the action of $g$.

## 2. Warm-up intuition: fixing vectors

Think about a linear map $T: V \to V$ and a basis where $T$ is diagonal:

$$
T =
\begin{pmatrix}
\lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & \lambda_n
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Then:

$$
\operatorname{trace}(T) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \dots + \lambda_n.
$$

If $\lambda_i = 1$, that direction is **fixed** by $T$.

If $\lambda_i = -1$, that direction is **flipped**.

If $\lambda_i$ is a complex root of unity, that direction is being **rotated**.

So:

> The trace counts fixed directions, weighting them by how they transform.

If $T$ fixes $k$ independent directions and messes up the rest, the trace will often be close to $k$.

This is the seed of the idea:

> trace ≈ "how much stays in place"

## 3. Example: rotation of the plane

Let $R_\theta$ be rotation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by angle $\theta$:

$$
R_\theta =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Its trace is:

$$
\chi(R_\theta) = 2\cos\theta.
$$

Interpretation:

- if $\theta = 0$, everything is fixed → $\chi = 2$
- if $\theta = \pi$, everything flips → $\chi = -2$
- if $\theta = 2\pi/3$, nothing stays in place → $\chi = -1$

The trace is literally “how much the rotation leaves unchanged.”

---

## 4. Example: the triangle representation from Post 1

Recall the representation of $S_3$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ that permutes coordinates.

- identity:

$$
I =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0\\
0&1&0\\
0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad
\chi(e)=3
$$

Everything stays where it is → trace $3$.

- a transposition $(2 3)$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0\\
0&0&1\\
0&1&0
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad \chi = 1
$$

Vertex $1$ stays fixed, vertices $2$ and $3$ swap.  
So “one direction survives.”

- a $120^\circ$ rotation $(123)$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0&0&1\\
1&0&0\\
0&1&0
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad \chi = 0
$$

Nothing stays put → trace $0$.

This perfectly matches the geometric intuition.

## 5. The first magical fact

Characters have a stunning property:

> Characters are constant on conjugacy classes.

Meaning:

If $hgh^{-1}$ is a conjugate of $g$, then

$$
\chi(hgh^{-1}) = \chi(g).
$$

Why?

Because:

$$
\rho(hgh^{-1}) = \rho(h)\rho(g)\rho(h)^{-1}
$$

and trace doesn’t change under similarity:

$$
\operatorname{trace}(PAP^{-1}) = \operatorname{trace}(A).
$$

So the character depends only on the **cycle structure** (in the case of $S_n$) or the symmetry type geometrically.

This already explains why character tables are organized by conjugacy classes.

---

## 6. Why this matters

Instead of:

- 6 matrices for $S_3$,
- each $3\times3$,
- $54$ numbers total,

we can work with:

- 3 conjugacy classes,
- 3 character values.

The character compresses the representation massively while **keeping the important information**.

This is why people sometimes say:

> A character is the “shadow” of a representation.

## 7. Where we’re going next

In the next post we’ll do something hands-on:

> build the entire character table of $S_3$ from scratch.

We will see:

- all irreducible representations of $S_3$
- how orthogonality of characters appears
- why the table looks the way it does

And after that, we’ll connect to:

- inner products of characters
- decomposing representations
- and eventually: my research notes on GVZ groups and o-basis groups
