# Conic sections from eccentricity

Most people first meet conics by “cutting the cone,” but there’s a really nice
way to describe them using **eccentricity** \( e \).

- \(0 \le e < 1\): ellipse  
- \(e = 1\): parabola  
- \(e > 1\): hyperbola  

Here’s a small interactive block — move the slider and watch the curve change.

The polar equation we’re using here is

$$
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

where \(p\) is the semi-latus rectum (we fixed it to \(p = 1\) in the demo).
