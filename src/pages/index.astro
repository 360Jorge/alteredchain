      <h1>Exploring Mathematics, Physics, and Patterns</h1>

      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jorge — a student of mathematics with a constant curiosity for
        the deep structures that connect abstract theory and the physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is my digital lab — a space where I explore how ideas from
        pure math, physics, and data intertwine, from symmetry in tensor spaces
        to the hidden patterns behind real-world systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a fellow math enthusiast, a student navigating science, or
        someone intrigued by how abstract reasoning explains reality, this blog
        offers a mix of rigorous analysis, creative inquiry, and reflections on
        the evolving landscape of mathematical and scientific discovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to start</h2>

      <p>
        If you're new here, here's the easiest way to explore:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="/visual-problems/">Path</a></strong> — my
          problem-solving hub. This is where I collect interesting problems
          I've worked on (Putnam, GRE, and others), together with the tactics,
          visual ideas, and rabbit holes that came out of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></strong> — essays and explanations
          on topics from algebra and representation theory to physics and
          dynamics, plus anything I find mathematically beautiful or surprising.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Featured post</h2>

      <p>
        A good place to begin is with a bit of circle geometry inspired by
        <em>Stranger Things</em>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          <a href="/blog/stranger-things-circle/">
            How a Circle Trick Revealed the Upside Down
          </a>
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Problem-solving toolbox</h2>

      <p>
        I'm fascinated by <strong>problem-solving itself</strong> — how a clever trick
        or a small shift in perspective can make a tough problem unfold. Over
        time I've been building a toolbox of tactics I use on contests and
        challenging problems: modular arithmetic shortcuts, symmetry arguments,
        geometric transformations, and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can explore these ideas, along with full write-ups of the problems
        that motivated them, in <a href="/visual-problems/">Path</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>One theorem on my mind</h2>

      <p>
        Currently, one of my favorite theorems is Maschke’s Theorem — a
        fundamental result in representation theory which states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Every finite-dimensional representation of a finite group over a field
        of characteristic not dividing the order of the group is completely
        reducible.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It’s a beautifully precise insight into how symmetry can be decomposed —
        and it reflects the kind of structure and elegance I hope to uncover in
        both mathematics and physics. I write more about results like this, and
        how they connect to other areas, on the <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for visiting — I hope you find something here that makes you
        think a little differently about mathematics.
