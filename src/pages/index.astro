      <h1>Exploring Mathematics and Patterns</h1>

      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jorge — a student of mathematics with a constant curiosity for
        the deep structures that connect abstract theory and the physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately, I’ve also been obsessed with a related question: where does
        <strong>mathematical insight</strong> actually come from — and what happens
        when we try to make that insight explicit in formal proof systems and AI?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is my digital lab — a space where I explore how ideas from
        pure math, physics, and data intertwine, from symmetry in tensor spaces
        to the hidden patterns behind real-world systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a fellow math enthusiast, a student navigating science, or
        someone intrigued by how abstract reasoning explains reality, this blog
        offers a mix of rigorous analysis, creative inquiry, and reflections on
        the evolving landscape of mathematical and scientific discovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to start</h2>

      <p>
        If you're new here, here's the easiest way to explore:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="/visual-problems/">Path</a></strong> — my
          problem-solving hub. This is where I collect interesting problems
          I've worked on (Putnam, GRE, and others), together with the tactics,
          visual ideas, and rabbit holes that came out of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></strong> — essays and explanations
          on topics from algebra and representation theory to physics and
          dynamics, plus anything I find mathematically beautiful or surprising.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Featured post</h2>

      <p>
        If you want a post that captures what I’ve been thinking about lately —
        contest problems, structure, and what formal proofs reveal — start here:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          <a href="/blog/putnam-2016-a1-where-insight-lives/">
            Putnam 2016 A1: Where Insight Lives (and Why Formal Proofs Expose It)
          </a>
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>From problems to systems</h2>

      <p>
        I’m fascinated by <strong>how reasoning works</strong> — not just how to
        finish a proof once the right idea is known, but how that idea is found in
        the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s why I like Putnam-style problems: they force you to notice structure
        before you can “compute” anything. And it’s also why I’m interested in
        formal proof assistants (like Lean) and math-focused AI: they’re excellent
        at verification, but they expose exactly where the human part of math still
        lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        If that kind of thinking resonates, you’ll probably enjoy exploring
        <a href="/visual-problems/">Path</a> and the essays on the <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>One theorem on my mind</h2>

      <p>
        Currently, one of my favorite theorems is Maschke’s Theorem — a
        fundamental result in representation theory which states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Every finite-dimensional representation of a finite group over a field
        of characteristic not dividing the order of the group is completely
        reducible.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I love it because it’s a theorem about <strong>decomposition</strong>:
        when symmetry looks complicated, it can often be broken into clean,
        understandable pieces — the kind of structural clarity I care about in
        both pure math and modern computational settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for visiting — I hope you find something here that makes you
        think a little differently about mathematics.
