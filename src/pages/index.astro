  <h1>Welcome to Altered Chain</h1>

  <p>
    Hello, I'm Jorge — a student of mathematics with an insatiable curiosity for the deep structures that govern both abstract theory and the physical world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Altered Chain is my digital laboratory: a space where I explore the interplay between pure mathematics, physics, and data — from symmetry in tensor spaces to the hidden patterns behind real-world systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're a fellow math enthusiast, a student navigating science, or someone intrigued by the foundations of reality, this blog offers a blend of rigorous analysis, creative inquiry, and reflections on the evolving landscape of mathematical and scientific discovery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Join me as I unravel chains of abstraction, connect ideas across disciplines, and contribute to a community passionate about understanding the universe through the lens of mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, one of my favorite theorems is Maschke’s Theorem — a fundamental result in representation theory which states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Every finite-dimensional representation of a finite group over a field of characteristic not dividing the order of the group is completely reducible.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It’s a beautifully precise insight into how symmetry can be decomposed — and it reflects the kind of structure and elegance I hope to uncover in both mathematics and physics.
