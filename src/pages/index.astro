      <h1>Welcome to Altered Chain</h1>

      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jorge — a student of mathematics with a constant curiosity for
        the deep structures that connect abstract theory and the physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Altered Chain is my digital lab — a space where I explore how ideas from
        pure math, physics, and data intertwine, from symmetry in tensor spaces
        to the hidden patterns behind real-world systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a fellow math enthusiast, a student navigating science, or
        someone intrigued by how abstract reasoning explains reality, this blog
        offers a mix of rigorous analysis, creative inquiry, and reflections on
        the evolving landscape of mathematical and scientific discovery.
      </p>

        I'm also fascinated by <strong>problem-solving itself</strong> — how a clever trick
        or a small shift in perspective can make a tough problem unfold. Here’s
        one of the problem-solving principles I keep in mind:

        Join me as I connect ideas across disciplines and contribute to a
        community passionate about understanding the universe through the lens
        of mathematics.

        Currently, one of my favorite theorems is Maschke’s Theorem — a
        fundamental result in representation theory which states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Every finite-dimensional representation of a finite group over a field
        of characteristic not dividing the order of the group is completely
        reducible.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It’s a beautifully precise insight into how symmetry can be decomposed —
        and it reflects the kind of structure and elegance I hope to uncover in
        both mathematics and physics.
