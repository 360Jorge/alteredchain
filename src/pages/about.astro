    Hi, I’m Jorge Guzman — a mathematics student based in Atlanta, Georgia, currently finishing my undergraduate degree and preparing to apply for a PhD in pure math.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created Altered Chain to document my journey through advanced mathematics and its intersections with physics, data science, and the philosophical questions that keep curious minds up at night. My current interests lie in representation theory, algebraic topology, and the ways these abstract structures connect to the language of the physical universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m fascinated by how beauty and logic emerge in math — how ideas like symmetry, invariance, or compactness help us make sense of both theory and reality. Whether it’s a proof in topology, a tensor construction, or a data pattern that hints at something deeper, I enjoy breaking ideas down, wrestling with complexity, and seeking clarity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long term, I want to do work that contributes to both science and the human imagination — to uncover new ideas, share them clearly, and help others discover the joy of thinking for themselves. Whether through research, writing, or teaching, I hope to inspire the kind of curiosity that moves minds and reshapes what we believe is possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not studying or writing, I enjoy film, good questions, and conversation with people who love learning as much as I do.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog is a space for reflection, exploration, and growth. If you’re interested in math, science, or simply in how ideas evolve, I hope you find something here that resonates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s build something meaningful — one idea at a time.
