# Proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational

Let's go through a classic **proof by contradiction** step-by-step.

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={0.1}>
**Assume** $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.  
Then we can write $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are integers with no common factor (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms).
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={0.3}>
Squaring both sides:  
$2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \Rightarrow a^2 = 2b^2$
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={0.5}>
This implies $a^2$ is even $\Rightarrow$ $a$ must also be even.  
So let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={0.7}>
Substitute back:  
$a^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2b^2 \Rightarrow b^2 = 2k^2$
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={0.9}>
So $b^2$ is also even $\Rightarrow$ $b$ is even.
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={1.1}>
But now **both $a$ and $b$ are even**, meaning they share a factor of 2 â€”  
**contradicting** our assumption that $\frac{a}{b}$ was in lowest terms!
</AnimatedProofStep>

<AnimatedProofStep client:load delay={1.3}>
$\boxed{\text{Therefore, }\sqrt{2}\text{ is irrational.}}$
</AnimatedProofStep>
