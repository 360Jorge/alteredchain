In Season 5, Episode 4 of *Stranger Things*, Dustin does something that looks like TV magic:  
he places **three marks** on a map, draws a few lines, and suddenly realizes the Upside Down is surrounded by a **perfect circle** — and that he and the gang are **outside** of it.

It feels dramatic, but the method he uses is both mathematically valid and remarkably elegant.

This is one of the rare moments where Stranger Things leans *directly* into real geometry.

# The Scene: A Strange Frequency From the Wall

Here’s the key dialogue that reveals what Dustin is actually doing:

> **Dustin:** “My telemetry tracker picked up a weird frequency coming from the wall,  
> and it took me a bit to place, but I’ve heard it before. Rather, **we** have.  
> Remember when we were out looking for Hop, and you heard that sound off Irwin Road?”  
>   
> **Jonathan:** “Yeah. You said it was an interference.”  
>   
> **Dustin:** “It was.  
> But this interference, it wasn’t coming from a military broadcast or EMI.  
> It was coming from this wall — which is important, because that gives us **three known locations**.  
> So, I connected the dots, measured the midpoints,  
> drew the **perpendicular bisectors**—”

This moment is everything.

Dustin literally describes the classical geometric construction for finding the circle determined by three points.

Let’s unpack it.

# Three Points Are Enough to Determine a Circle

A fundamental theorem of Euclidean geometry states:

> **Any three non-collinear points determine a unique circle.**

If the three “weird frequency” detections are points  
$A$, $B$, and $C$ on the boundary of the Upside Down wall,  
then the circle containing them is called the **circumcircle**.

To find it, Dustin uses the standard geometric construction:

1. Connect $A$–$B$ and $B$–$C$ to form a triangle.  
2. Find the **midpoints** of those two segments.  
3. Draw the **perpendicular bisector** of each segment.  
4. The bisectors intersect at a single point:  
   the **circumcenter**, which is the center $(h,k)$ of the circle.  
5. Measure the distance from $(h,k)$ to any of the three points to get the radius $R$.

Formally, the circumcenter $(h,k)$ satisfies:

$$
(h - x_1)^2 + (k - y_1)^2
= (h - x_2)^2 + (k - y_2)^2
= (h - x_3)^2 + (k - y_3)^2.
$$

And the radius is:

$$
R = \sqrt{(x_1 - h)^2 + (y_1 - k)^2}.
$$

These equations ensure that all three points lie on the same circle.

Dustin didn’t need to walk the entire perimeter —  
**three contact points are enough**.

# What Dustin’s Construction Means Physically

Each time the telemetry tracker picked up interference,  
it meant they were **exactly $R$ units away from the circular boundary** at that moment.

Those three detections correspond to **three boundary points**.

Once he places them on the map, connecting the dots and constructing the perpendicular bisectors gives him:

- the shape of the wall (a circle)
- the exact center of the Upside Down boundary
- the radius
- and — most importantly — their relation to it

He realizes instantly:

> **They are outside the circle.  
> And if you are outside a circle, every direction eventually intersects it.**

This is why he concludes:

- there’s no “gap”  
- no open side  
- no way to walk around  
- the wall completely encloses the Upside Down  

They are outside a closed curve.

# A Real Scientific Technique (Not Sci-Fi)

What Dustin is doing mirrors how scientists determine shapes they can’t physically explore:

- **GPS trilateration**  
- **Earthquake epicenter location**  
- **Mapping volcanic calderas**  
- **Seismic void detection**  
- **Astronomical orbit determination**  
- **CT scan inverse reconstruction**  

In all these cases:

> **A few local measurements reveal a global structure.**

Dustin uses three frequency detections to reconstruct an entire boundary.

The Upside Down’s wall is enormous — but the math does the walking for him.

# Why This Moment Is Beautiful

Stranger Things is full of the supernatural, but this scene is pure mathematics:

- connecting three known points  
- constructing perpendicular bisectors  
- finding the circumcenter  
- revealing a circular barrier  
- and understanding its consequences

It shows a simple but deep truth:

> **With the right math, you don’t need to explore the whole world to understand its shape.**  
> Sometimes three points are enough.

Three strange frequencies.  
One circle.  
No way around.

The algebra solves the mystery long before the characters do.
