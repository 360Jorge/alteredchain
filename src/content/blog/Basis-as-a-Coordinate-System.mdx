When we first learn vectors, coordinates feel absolute.

A vector is  

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$

and that’s that.

But linear algebra quietly hides a deeper truth:

> **Coordinates are not properties of vectors — they are properties of vectors relative to a basis.**

This post is about making that idea feel inevitable, not memorized.

## The familiar picture: the standard basis

In $\mathbb{R}^2$, we usually work with the standard basis

$$
e_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad
e_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Geometrically, these vectors define the horizontal and vertical directions.  
If we place a vector $x$ with tail at the origin, we can write it as

$$
x = 7e_1 + 4e_2.
$$

That statement already contains structure:

- the numbers $7$ and $4$ are **coordinates**
- the vectors $e_1, e_2$ define the **grid** we are measuring against

This is the coordinate system we implicitly use when we write

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix}7 \\ 4\end{bmatrix}.
$$

So far, nothing surprising.

## A different grid, same vector

Now comes the important shift.

Suppose instead we choose two different vectors:

$$
b_1 = \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}, \quad
b_2 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}.
$$

These vectors are not perpendicular, not unit length, and not aligned with the axes —  
but they still span the plane.

With respect to this new pair, the *same geometric vector* $x$ can be written as

$$
x = 2b_1 + 1b_2.
$$

Suddenly, the coordinates of $x$ are no longer $(7,4)$.  
They are now $(2,1)$.

Nothing about the vector changed.  
Only the **coordinate system** did.

## Visual intuition: changing the grid, not the vector

Imagine freezing the vector $x$ in place.

It stays exactly where it is in the plane. We are not allowed to move it.

Now do the following mental experiment:

1. Draw the standard grid formed by $e_1$ and $e_2$.
   - horizontal lines every unit  
   - vertical lines every unit  
   - coordinates $(7,4)$ make sense because the grid is rectangular

2. Erase the grid, but keep the vector.

3. Draw a new grid using $b_1$ and $b_2$.
   - lines parallel to $b_1$  
   - lines parallel to $b_2$  
   - the grid is skewed, not orthogonal

Suddenly, the same point sits at the intersection corresponding to $(2,1)$.

Nothing moved.  
Only the **ruler** changed.

That’s what a change of basis really is:
- not rotating the vector  
- not stretching space  
- but replacing the measuring grid underneath it

## What actually changed?

This is the key insight:

- A **vector** is a geometric object.
- A **basis** is a measuring device.
- **Coordinates depend on the measuring device.**

When we choose a basis, we are deciding:
- which directions count as “one unit”
- how movement in space is decomposed
- how numbers are assigned meaning

In this sense, a basis is not just a set of vectors —  
it is a **coordinate system**.

## Why not any collection of vectors?

Not every set of vectors can play this role.

- A single vector can’t describe the whole plane — some directions are unreachable.
- Too many vectors can describe the same point in multiple ways, destroying uniqueness.

For coordinates to make sense, we need:

1. **Existence** — every vector must be reachable  
2. **Uniqueness** — every vector must have exactly one coordinate description  

These requirements are precisely why bases are defined using:
- spanning
- linear independence

The definition is not arbitrary — it is forced by the idea of coordinates itself.

---

## The takeaway

When you write

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix}7 \\ 4\end{bmatrix},
$$

you are secretly saying:

> “The coordinate vector of $x$ relative to the standard basis is $(7,4)$.”

Linear algebra begins when we stop treating that statement as obvious  
and start asking what happens when the basis changes.

That’s where structure lives.

### What’s next

In the next post, we’ll answer a natural question:

**Why do we need *both* spanning and linear independence — and what breaks when one is missing?**

That question turns out to explain half of linear algebra.
