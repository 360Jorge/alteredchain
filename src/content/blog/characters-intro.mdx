In the last weeks of my Abstract Algebra 2 course, we moved from modules and group
algebras to **representations** and finally to **characters**.

The setup looks like this: we start with a finite group $G$, a complex vector space $V$,
and a homomorphism
$$
\rho : G \to \mathrm{GL}(V).
$$

The **character** of this representation is the function
$$
\chi(g) = \mathrm{tr}(\rho(g)),
$$
the trace of the matrix representing $\rho(g)$ with respect to some basis of $V$.

One of the beautiful facts I learned from Dr. Harmon’s notes is that:

- $\chi(e) = \dim_\mathbb{C} V$, and  
- $\chi$ is constant on conjugacy classes, so it really lives on the set of conjugacy classes of $G$.

## Character tables in action

Instead of writing a static table in LaTeX, let’s play with a few small groups and
their irreducible characters. Each row is an irreducible character, and each column
is a conjugacy class.

<CharacterTableGenerator />

You can see a few important patterns immediately:

- For each group, the sum of the squares of the degrees of the irreducible characters
  equals $|G|$.
- For abelian groups like $\mathbb{Z}_4$, all irreducible characters are 1-dimensional.
- For non-abelian examples like $S_3$ and $D_4$, you start seeing higher-dimensional
  representations and more interesting character values.

## How this connects back to modules

Earlier in the course, we built the theory of $R$-modules and tensor products.
In that language:

- Complex representations of $G$ are the same as **$\mathbb{C}G$-modules**.
- Simple $\mathbb{C}G$-modules correspond to the rows in the character table.
- Maschke’s Theorem (under $\mathrm{char} \mathbb{C} \nmid |G|$) tells us that
  every $\mathbb{C}G$-module decomposes as a direct sum of simple modules, which
  shows up as decomposing characters into irreducibles.

In future posts, I’ll go back to Dr. Harmon’s “Investigations” and unpack how
modules, group algebras, and tensor products build up the language needed to
even state these theorems.
