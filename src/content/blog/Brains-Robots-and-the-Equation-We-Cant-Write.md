Sometimes I find myself thinking about why humans can move, react, and learn so effortlessly while robots—despite all their power—still struggle to pick up an apple without making a mess.

I don’t know much about robotics or control theory, but I do know curiosity.  
So instead of pretending to be an expert, I decided to have a conversation.

With myself.

Like Galileo once did, when talking about the motion of planets was risky…  
except my dangers are mostly intellectual, not theological 

The voices are familiar: the Dreamer, the Engineer, and someone unexpected.

*Full disclosure:* the Engineer voice was inspired by my late-night discussions with ChatGPT. Yes, I consult an AI about robots. Irony noted.

### **Dreamer:**  
Everyone says robots will replace us soon. If they’re so advanced, why can’t they do the simple things we do?

### **Engineer:**  
“Simple”? You think picking up an apple is simple?

It looks easy because *you* do it. But the moment a robot touches something, physics turns into chaos—friction, slip, deformation, unexpected forces.

### **Dreamer:**  
But my brain handles it effortlessly. I don’t even think about it.

### **Engineer:**  
Exactly. Humans adjust *before* mistakes happen. Robots adjust *after*.

That’s the real gap. Not power. Not speed.

Sensorimotor intelligence.

### **Dreamer:**  
So there has to be something deeper behind it.  
An equation.  
A principle.  
Something that ties prediction, movement, and learning together.

### **Engineer:**  
Maybe. In control theory they’d say something boring like:

$$
\text{error} = y_{\text{actual}} - y_{\text{predicted}}
$$

You predict what should happen, compare it to reality, and adjust.

Robots need explicit equations like that.

Your brain… doesn’t.

It seems to learn its own.

### **Dreamer:**  
Which means we can describe what the brain *does*…  
but not *how* it does it.

---

*A faint cough echoes in the background.*

### **Gödel:**  
You may never be able to write that equation.

### **Dreamer:**  
Bro, who invited you?

### **Gödel:**  
Logic did.

---

### **Engineer:**  
Great. Here we go.

### **Gödel:**  
Even if there *is* a principle like

$$
\min \left| \text{error} \right|
$$

you might be unable to formalize it from within the system that uses it.

A system cannot fully describe itself.

### **Dreamer:**  
So you’re saying the brain might be running a beautiful hidden rule…

…but we can’t *express* it?

### **Gödel:**  
Precisely.

---

### **Engineer:**  
Or maybe there’s no elegant rule at all.  
Maybe it’s just millions of evolutionary hacks duct-taped together.

### **Dreamer:**  
Even if that were true… I want to look for it.

### **Engineer:**  
Why?

### **Dreamer:**  
Because I’m a scientist.  
I have to believe there’s something there and try regardless.

---

Sometimes I think about this as I work on applications for graduate school.  
I don’t just want a degree—I want to push against that boundary, even if I never reach the end of it.

Maybe I can do a little good along the way.  
Maybe I can help someone else fall in love with these questions.

Maybe estoy loco.  
But curiosity has carried humanity this far.

---

### **Gödel:**  
Even if the equation cannot be written?

### **Dreamer:**  
Especially then.

---

Maybe we’ll never find the missing equation.

But searching for it feels like one of the most human things we can do.

\*No AI was harmed in the making of this internal crisis.
