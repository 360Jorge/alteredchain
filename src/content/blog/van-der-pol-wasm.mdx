The Van der Pol oscillator is the nonlinear system

$$
x' = y, \qquad y' = \mu(1 - x^2)y - x,
$$

where $\mu$ controls the strength of the nonlinear damping.

The only equilibrium is at $(0,0)$. Linearizing near the origin gives

$$
\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
-1 & \mu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix},
$$

so the eigenvalues satisfy $\lambda^2 - \mu\lambda + 1 = 0$. In particular, when
$\mu = 0$ we have $\lambda = \pm i$, and as $\mu$ crosses $0$ the real part of
the eigenvalues changes sign. This change in stability is the local signature of
a **Hopf bifurcation**.

For $\mu < 0$ the origin is a stable spiral and trajectories decay to $(0,0)$.
For $\mu > 0$ the origin becomes unstable, but solutions do not blow up: the term
$\mu(1-x^2)y$ injects energy at small amplitudes and dissipates energy at large
amplitudes, producing a **stable limit cycle**.

In this demo, the trajectory is computed in **Rust**, compiled to **WebAssembly**,
and rendered in your browser using a `<canvas>`.

Try refreshing and watch how trajectories spiral away from the origin and settle
onto the same closed orbit. Next we’ll add a slider for $\mu$ (and optionally
initial conditions) to make the Hopf transition visible directly in the phase
portrait.
