The Van der Pol oscillator

$$
x' = y, \qquad y' = \mu(1 - x^2)y - x
$$

is a classic nonlinear system exhibiting limit cycles.

In this demo, the trajectory is computed in **Rust**, compiled to **WebAssembly**,
and rendered in your browser using a `<canvas>`.

Try refreshing and watch how the system spirals into its limit cycle. Later we
could add sliders for $\mu$, initial conditions, and even show both time series
and phase portrait.
